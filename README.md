# FAQ Chat bot

## Introduction
In this project, we develop an chat bot called fqa-bot that answer to frequent questions.


## Outline
To develop an FQA (Frequently Asked Questions) model, you would typically follow these steps:

- Data collection: Gather a set of frequently asked questions and their corresponding answers. These can come from various sources such as customer support tickets, knowledge bases, or online forums. The data should cover a wide range of topics.

- Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data. This step involves removing unnecessary characters, converting text to lowercase, removing stop words, and performing any other required text normalization techniques.

- Vectorization: Convert the preprocessed text data into numerical vectors that can be used as input to the machine learning model. There are several techniques for text vectorization, such as Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.

- Training data creation: Create a dataset for training the FQA model. Each data point should consist of a question and its corresponding answer. You can also add some negative samples or incorrect answers to make the training more robust.

- Model architecture: Choose a suitable model architecture for your FQA task. One popular approach is to use a sequence-to-sequence model with an attention mechanism. This allows the model to encode the input question and decode the corresponding answer.

- Model training: Train the FQA model using the prepared training dataset. This involves feeding the question-answer pairs into the model and optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the loss function. You can use techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent for training.

- Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained FQA model using an evaluation dataset. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score to measure the model's performance.

- Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can deploy it as an API or integrate it into your desired application or platform. Users can input their questions, and the model will provide corresponding answers based on its training.

It's important to note that implementing a robust FQA model requires a good understanding of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. You may consider using existing NLP libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Hugging Face's Transformers, which provide pre-trained models and utilities for building question-answering systems.

## Data collection
There is a subset of the [InsuranceQA Corpus](https://github.com/shuzi/insuranceQA) (1000 pairs of questions and answers) used in this demo, everyone can download on [Github](https://github.com/towhee-io/examples/releases/download/data/question_answer.csv)


## Data preprocessing
Text data preprocessing is an essential step when working with natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including building FQA models. Here are some common preprocessing techniques for text data:

- Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase to ensure consistency and remove any case-specific variations.

- Tokenization: Split the text into individual tokens or words. Tokenization can be performed using whitespace splitting, or more advanced techniques like word tokenization libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy) or regular expressions.

- Stop Word Removal: Remove common words that do not contribute much to the overall meaning of the text, such as "a," "the," "is." Stop word lists can be obtained from libraries like NLTK or spaCy.

- Punctuation Removal: Remove punctuation marks from the text, as they generally do not carry significant semantic information.

- Normalization: Perform various normalization techniques to handle different forms of words. For example:

- Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "running" to "run").
Stemming: Reduce words to their root form using heuristics (e.g., "running" to "run").
Removing Special Characters: Remove special characters, symbols, or non-alphanumeric characters from the text.

- Handling Contractions: Expand contractions to their full forms (e.g., "don't" to "do not").

- Handling Numerical Data: Decide how to handle numerical values, whether to replace them with placeholders or convert them to textual representations.

- Handling HTML Tags: If working with text extracted from HTML, remove any HTML tags and extract the relevant text.

- Handling Noise: Address noisy or unstructured text data by removing irrelevant characters, URLs, email addresses, or any other specific patterns that may not be relevant to the task.

These preprocessing techniques can be applied using various Python libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, or scikit-learn, depending on your specific requirements. It's important to experiment and adjust the preprocessing steps based on your dataset and the specific NLP task you're working on.
